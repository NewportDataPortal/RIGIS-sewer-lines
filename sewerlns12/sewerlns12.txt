    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Information was supplied either electronically as shapefiles, CAD files, PDF maps, image files or hardcopy maps. Electronic data in the form of shapefiles or CAD files contained data that were not used to generate the sewerlines for this coverage. Locational data  extracted to map the service lines. Hardcopy maps  electronically scanned, imported into ArcMap and georeferenced . Wastewater Facilities Plans submitted to RIDEM for review  used where no other sources were available. The new sewer lines were then drawn to conform to the road coverage of RI base maps. The original 1996 RIGIS dataset was unaltered except where major discrepancies between the existing and new updates were observed. Sewer services in Providence are assumed to be available throughout the town and are drawn concurrent with streets. No updates were made to areas or towns that did not provide maps.
